<h2>About this repository</h2>
<p>
  This repository is dedicated to learning and practising Application Security and secure programming practices,
  with a special focus on web application penetration testing and bug bounty techniques.
</p>
<p>
  The goal is to create an intentionally vulnerable Go web application — then identify and fix its security issues.
  This gives a safe, hands-on environment to learn vulnerability discovery, exploitation and remediation.
</p>
<p>
  (Also serves as the codebase for the Go server I was building — everything is organized so you can test, break
  and improve the app incrementally.)
</p>
<p>
  As the project becomes more complex, i'll keep it updated.
</p>
<p>
  I'll make the code review in another repository
</p>
